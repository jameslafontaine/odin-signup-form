# Odin Sign-Up Form

A sign-up form project created as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) Intermediate HTML and
CSS section. This project demonstrates intermediate CSS skills, focusing on styling and validating forms, as well as
using more advanced selectors and pseudo-classes.

## Project Description

This project involves building a sign-up form for a fictional service. The main goal is to practice form structure in
HTML, along with applying CSS techniques to style inputs, labels, and validation states.
The project emphasizes accessibility, usability, and clean design.

## Features

### Form Structure

Includes labeled input fields for user information such as name, email, phone number, and password.

### Validation

Demonstrates usage of both required fields and built-in HTML type validation to ensure proper data entry.

### Styling

Inputs, labels, and error messages styled with CSS for clarity and improved user experience.

### Layout

Uses CSS techniques such as flexbox and positioning to create a clean, user-friendly layout.

### Submit Button

A styled button with hover effects to provide visual feedback.

## Learning Objectives

This project demonstrates:

-   **Form Basics**: Correct use of form elements like `<input>`, `<label>`, and `<button>`.
-   **Validation**: Applying HTML5 attributes and CSS pseudo-classes (e.g., `:invalid`) to highlight form states.
-   **Flexbox Layout**: Using flexbox to align and space form fields effectively.
-   **CSS Styling**: Improving the user experience through styled inputs, error messages, and focus effects.
-   **Accessibility Considerations**: Ensuring form labels and structures are accessible to screen readers.
